# Schema Observations
When given data to use one of the first things a human, or a machine, needs to do is to familiarize themselves with the data.
In some fields, this is familiarization is known as data profiling.
It is, roughly speaking, an interactive process where a user observes and examines the data. 
During this process, the user gathers information about values and schema.
The process often starts with building a big picture and locating main data objects.
A user may also deep dive into details of certain objects or values focusing their attention on an area of interest.
We view this process as a series of observations.

An observation aims to extract particular information from the data at hand.
Being that information about objects, values or any other deemed useful by the user.
It is from those observations, the user can understand the data.
An observation is an action, or a query, executed over the data to gain specific information.
The observation can be specific to a particular use-case or can require access to certain computation resources.
Therefore, a set of observations to execute is task specific.
This repository houses definitions and execution scripts for observations.
